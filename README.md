# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
In this analysis we are assisting Maria, a Chief Data Scientitst of a city school distric, she is responsible for preparing all standarized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation to provide insight about performance trends and patterns. We analysed data on student funding and student's standarized test scores by aggregating data and show casing trends in school performaces. 

The school board notifies Maria that one of the files (students_complete.csv) shows evidence of academic dishonesty for reading and math grades in Thomas High School ninth graders and they appear to have been altered. 

We will modifying the math and reading scores for Thomas High School for the ninth graders to show NaNs and once we replace this datat we will repeat the school district analysis. This analysis will assist the school board and superintendent make the decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.
